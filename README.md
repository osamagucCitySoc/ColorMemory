============
Notes:
	1.	Included the whole project that runs on 6.0+.
	2.	The document requests targeting 4.0+ but i have had done it for 6.0+ for three reasons:
	  -	The statistics shown by Apple.com itself (https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/) is showing that 91% of devices are 7.0+ and 8% are 6.0+.
	  ⁃	Apple.com recommends minimum to target 6.0 because of the sever enhancements they had did from that time on (especially UI wise, as they have updated their UI guidelines after releasing 7.0).
	  ⁃	The earliest simulator i can install is 6.0 as of the release of Xcode 5.1 and MacOSX Mavericks (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19281739/use-ios-5-simulator-in-xcode-5).
	3.	Included as well an extensive Activity diagram, that draws in visual way how the flow of the app goes (accedo Task Activity Diagram.png).
	4.	Included as well the only server file used (syncEntries.php).
	5.	The server is live and ready to go.
